Introduction
==========================

KNconstraint is a software appling GW data or EM data to constraint kilonovae parameters. For the 
presence of GW/EM data, the package would give a best fit of result several sate-of-art kilonovae model, 
and for the absence of detection with upper limit given, model constraint would be precessed.
